To Do:


-----------------------------------------------------------
CPathSpeed::FindBoundAxisChange - problems with z ramping
tab settings 0.6 7 5 0.1 didn't work with "FRAMES SHAPES CUT to fix axis change.NCI"
tab settings 0.6 7 6 0.1 OK


Improve exact fit to 4 points! in PathNCIDoc.cpp line 1128

Handle arcs in xz & yz

Set servo position from encoder index

Allow for backlash

Tool selector with dimensions data - confirms tool with file
